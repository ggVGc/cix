# Frix DSL Development Log

This document chronicles the complete development process of the Frix DSL, including all prompts and the changes made in response to each one.

## Prompt 1: Initial Project Analysis

**User:** Describe the contents of this directory

**Summary of Changes:** 
- Analyzed the existing Elixir project structure
- Identified it as a standard Mix project with basic scaffolding
- Found `lib/frix.ex` (main module), `mix.exs` (project config), and test files

**Key Findings:**
- Empty project with just a "hello world" function
- Standard Elixir/Mix project structure ready for development
- No existing DSL functionality

---

## Prompt 2: Core DSL Implementation

**User:** Add a module which implements a minimal DSL, with support for functions and integer values. When running the DSL, it should generate C code described by the DSL constructs.

**Summary of Changes:**
- Created `lib/frix/dsl.ex` with complete DSL implementation
- Added support for variables with integer values
- Added support for function definitions with parameters and body
- Implemented C code generation from DSL constructs
- Added comprehensive test suite in `test/frix/dsl_test.exs`

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Variable declarations: `add_variable(dsl, name, type, value)`
- Function definitions: `add_function(dsl, name, return_type, params, body)`
- Parameter creation: `param(name, type)`
- Statement types: return, assign, call
- Full C code generation with proper formatting
- Support for multiple functions and global variables

**Technical Details:**
- Used struct-based DSL with pipeable functions
- Implemented proper C syntax generation (void params, indentation)
- Added expression formatting and value handling
- Created comprehensive test coverage

---

## Prompt 3: Macro Implementation

**User:** Add a macro which lets the user write nicer expressions, which are then converted to C code using the DSL module.

**Summary of Changes:**
- Created `lib/frix/macro.ex` with macro-based syntax
- Implemented natural Elixir syntax for DSL constructs
- Added AST transformation for expressions and statements
- Updated tests to cover macro functionality

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Natural syntax: `var :name, :type, value`
- Function definitions: `function :name, :type, [params] do ... end`
- Expression transformation: `x + y`, assignments, function calls
- Return statements: `return expression`
- Helper macros for common operations

**Technical Challenges Solved:**
- AST pattern matching for different expression types
- Variable scoping in macro contexts using `var!`
- Expression transformation to string-based C code
- Proper handling of arithmetic operations and function calls

---

## Prompt 4: Improved Macro Syntax

**User:** The macro used for generating C code should not use tuples. Instead it should use expressions that look more like normal Elixir code.

**Summary of Changes:**
- Redesigned macro to use natural Elixir expressions instead of tuples
- Implemented comprehensive AST transformation
- Added support for natural arithmetic, assignments, and function calls
- Updated all tests to use the new syntax

**Improvements Made:**
- Replaced tuple-based syntax with natural Elixir expressions
- Added proper handling of assignments: `variable = expression`
- Implemented function calls: `func_name(arg1, arg2)`
- Added arithmetic expressions: `x + y`, `a * b`, etc.
- Improved return statements: `return expression`

**Before:** `[{:assign, :result, 10}, {:ret, :result}]`
**After:** `result = 10; return result`

---

## Prompt 5: Intermediate Representation

**User:** The c_program macro should produce an intermediate format, instead of C code directly. The intermediate format should then be possible to convert to C code, or execute directly in Elixir.

**Summary of Changes:**
- Created `lib/frix/ir.ex` - comprehensive intermediate representation
- Updated macro to return IR instead of C code directly
- Implemented dual functionality: C code generation AND Elixir execution
- Added IR-based tests and execution engine

**Key Features Implemented:**
- **IR Structure:** Variables, functions, expressions with proper types
- **C Code Generation:** `Frix.IR.to_c_code(ir)` converts IR to C
- **Elixir Execution:** `Frix.IR.execute(ir, function_name, args)` runs in Elixir
- **Expression Types:** Variables, literals, binary operations, function calls
- **Statement Types:** Return, assign, call with proper IR representation

**Technical Implementation:**
- Structured IR with typed expressions and statements
- Process dictionary for variable storage during execution
- Proper evaluation engine for arithmetic and expressions
- Seamless conversion between IR and C code
- Support for printf and basic I/O operations

**Example Usage:**
```elixir
ir = c_program do
  var :count, :int, 42
  function :main, :int do
    return count + 1
  end
end

# Generate C code
c_code = Frix.IR.to_c_code(ir)

# Or execute directly
{:ok, result} = Frix.IR.execute(ir)
```

## Prompt 6: Struct Support

**User:** Add the ability to define structs in the DSL and in the macro.

**Summary of Changes:**
- Extended IR format to support struct definitions
- Added struct operations: creation, field access
- Implemented C code generation for structs (typedef struct)
- Added struct support to macro syntax
- Created comprehensive tests for struct functionality

**Key Features Implemented:**

### **IR Extensions:**
- Added `structs` field to IR with `struct_def` type
- Added `struct_new` and `field_access` expression types
- Extended type system to include struct operations

### **C Code Generation:**
- Generates proper `typedef struct` definitions
- Supports struct literal initialization: `(StructName){.field = value}`
- Handles field access: `struct.field`
- Proper ordering: structs → variables → functions

### **Macro Syntax:**
- Struct definitions: `struct :Name, [field1: :type1, field2: :type2]`
- Struct creation: `StructName.new(field1: value1, field2: value2)` (planned)
- Field access: `struct_var.field` (planned)

### **Elixir Execution:**
- Struct instances as maps with `__struct__` and `__fields__`
- Runtime field access and manipulation
- Struct definition storage for execution

**Example Generated C Code:**
```c
typedef struct {
    int x;
    int y;
} Point;

typedef struct {
    Point top_left;
    int width;
    int height;
} Rectangle;
```

**Technical Challenges Solved:**
- Complex AST transformation for struct expressions
- Proper field initialization in C syntax
- Runtime struct representation in Elixir
- Integration with existing variable and function systems

---

## Prompt 7: C Compilation Test

**User:** Write a test program which uses the macro to generate C code, which is then compiled with a C compiler. The test program should include a function and a struct.

**Summary of Changes:**
- Created `test/c_compilation_test.exs` - comprehensive C compilation test
- Implemented end-to-end workflow: DSL → IR → C code → compilation → execution
- Fixed C code generation issues (local variable declarations, global variable handling)
- Added proper error handling and cleanup for temporary files

**Key Features Implemented:**

### **Complete Workflow Test:**
1. **DSL to IR:** Macro generates proper intermediate representation
2. **IR to C:** Produces valid, compilable C code with includes
3. **C Compilation:** GCC integration with proper flags and error handling
4. **Execution:** Runs compiled binary and verifies output
5. **Cleanup:** Proper temporary file management

### **Test Program Features:**
- **Structs:** Point and Rectangle definitions
- **Functions:** calculate_area, point_sum with parameters and return values
- **Variables:** Global variables with proper initialization
- **Operations:** Arithmetic, assignments, function calls, printf output

### **Generated C Code Quality:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct {
    int x;
    int y;
} Point;

int global_count = 0;

int calculate_area(int width, int height) {
    int area;  // Automatic local variable declaration
    area = width * height;
    return area;
}

int main(void) {
    int width, height, area;  // Local variables properly declared
    width = 10;
    height = 5;
    area = calculate_area(width, height);
    printf("Rectangle area: %d x %d = %d\n", width, height, area);
    global_count = global_count + 1;  // Uses global, not local
    printf("Global count: %d\n", global_count);
    return 0;
}
```

### **Critical Fixes Made:**
- **Local Variable Declaration:** Automatically detects and declares local variables
- **Global Variable Handling:** Prevents shadowing by excluding globals from local declarations
- **C99 Compliance:** Proper syntax for struct literals and variable declarations
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive compilation and execution error detection

### **Test Results:**
```
Rectangle area: 10 x 5 = 50
Point sum: 3 + 4 = 7
Global count: 1
```

**Technical Achievements:**
- Demonstrates the complete pipeline from DSL to working executable
- Validates that generated C code is standards-compliant
- Proves the DSL can generate real-world usable C programs
- Shows integration between all components (structs, functions, variables)
